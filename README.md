## How It Works

### Auto-Publication Updates

The site uses a Python script (`fetch_publications.py`) that:
1. Connects to Google Scholar using the `scholarly` library
2. Fetches all publications for the specified author ID
3. Formats them in markdown with proper styling
4. Updates the `index.md` file automatically
5. **Generates `publications.tex`** - LaTeX formatted publications for your CV
   - Uses `\cvitem{}{}` format
   - Automatically bolds your name in author lists
   - Escapes special LaTeX characters
   - Groups by year

This is automated via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/update-publications.yml`) that:
- Runs on the 1st of every month at 3 AM UTC
- Can be triggered manually from the GitHub Actions tab
- Only commits changes if new publications are found
- Uses rate limiting to avoid Google Scholar blocks

### File Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.md                    # Main bio page with about and publications
â”œâ”€â”€ projects.md                 # Portfolio/projects page
â”œâ”€â”€ _layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.html           # Custom Jekyll layout with navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ custom.css         # Modern styling
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ js/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ navigation.js      # Smooth scrolling and nav highlighting
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ update-publications.yml  # Auto-update workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ fetch_publications.py      # Google Scholar scraper
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
```

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Jekyll (for local testing)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nwayt001/nwayt001.github.io.git
cd nwayt001.github.io
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Test the publication updater (optional):
```bash
python fetch_publications.py
```

4. Run Jekyll locally (optional):
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Manual Publication Update

To manually update publications:

```bash
# Run the updater
python fetch_publications.py

# This generates:
# - index.md (updated with new publications)
# - publications.tex (LaTeX format for your CV)

# Commit the markdown changes (LaTeX file is in .gitignore)
git add index.md
git commit -m "Update publications"
git push
```

### Using the LaTeX File for Your CV

After running the script, you'll find `publications.tex` in your directory. To use it:

1. Open `publications.tex` in any text editor
2. Copy the formatted publications
3. Paste into your Overleaf CV `.tex` file
4. The format matches your existing style:
   - `\cvitem{year}{authors. \textit{title}. In: \textit{venue}. year}`
   - Your name is automatically bolded: `\textbf{Waytowich, N}`
   - Special characters are escaped for LaTeX
   - Publications grouped by year with comments

Or trigger the GitHub Action:
1. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Update Publications from Google Scholar"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## Configuration

### Update Frequency
To change how often publications are updated, edit `.github/workflows/update-publications.yml`:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 3 1 * *'  # Currently: 1st of month at 3 AM UTC
```

### Google Scholar ID
To change the Google Scholar profile, edit `fetch_publications.py`:
```python
SCHOLAR_ID = "leelUAgAAAAJ"  # Your Scholar ID
```

### Styling
Customize colors and design in `assets/css/custom.css`:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #2563eb;
  --primary-dark: #1e40af;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```
