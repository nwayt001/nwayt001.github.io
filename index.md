## About Me

<!--I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist with the US Army Research Laboratory working on human-guided Machine Learning. I am also the lead scientist for the ARL's Human-Guided machine learning branch and lead a team of researchers developing novel algorithms for human-guided AI/ML. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow working under [Paul Sajda](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/paul-sajda) at Columbia University in the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing at Columbia University, NY developing novel brain-computer interfaces. I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Old Dominion University, studying under [Dean Krusienski](https://egr.vcu.edu/directory/dean.krusienski/), developing practical brain-computer interfaces. My research focuses on learning from human feedback using human-in-the-loop machine learning and reinforcment learning. In addition, my research interests include deep reinforcement learning, sequential decision-making, natural language processing, human-agent teaming, and human-robot collaboration. -->

I am Dr. Nicholas Waytowich, a Machine Learning Research Scientist with the US Army Research Laboratory, where my primary role revolves around human-guided Machine Learning. Currently, I take pride in being the lead scientist for the ARL’s Human-Guided Machine Learning Branch. Along with my dedicated team of researchers, we are at the forefront of devising innovative algorithms for human-guided AI/ML. My research shines a spotlight on harnessing human feedback through human-in-the-loop machine learning and reinforcement learning. My diverse interests span across human-guided machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, large-language models, human-agent teaming, and human-robot collaboration.

Before my stint with the Army Research Laboratory, I had the privilege of being a postdoctoral fellow under the esteemed [Paul Sajda](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/paul-sajda) at Columbia University in the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing. During this period, I delved deep into creating novel brain-computer interfaces. This pursuit was a continuation of my Ph.D. journey in Biomedical Engineering from Old Dominion University, where I worked closely with [Dean Krusienski](https://egr.vcu.edu/directory/dean.krusienski/) on practical brain-computer interface applications.

In addition to my research roles, I've been sharing my knowledge as an Adjunct Professor at Anne Arundel Community College since 2023. My entrepreneurial venture as the CEO and Co-Founder of AIMS-Technologies, LLC between 2019 and 2020 allowed me to pioneer research strategies to detect and counter non-cooperative, small unmanned aerial systems.

Having had the honor to present my findings at prominent conferences like AAAI, ICML, NeurIPS and AAMAS, I remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in my field.
