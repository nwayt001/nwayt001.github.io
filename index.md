## About Me

<!--I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist with the US Army Research Laboratory working on human-guided Machine Learning. I am also the lead scientist for the ARL's Human-Guided machine learning branch and lead a team of researchers developing novel algorithms for human-guided AI/ML. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow working under [Paul Sajda](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/paul-sajda) at Columbia University in the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing at Columbia University, NY developing novel brain-computer interfaces. I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Old Dominion University, studying under [Dean Krusienski](https://egr.vcu.edu/directory/dean.krusienski/), developing practical brain-computer interfaces. My research focuses on learning from human feedback using human-in-the-loop machine learning and reinforcment learning. In addition, my research interests include deep reinforcement learning, sequential decision-making, natural language processing, human-agent teaming, and human-robot collaboration. -->

I am Dr. Nicholas Waytowich, a Machine Learning Research Scientist with the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL), where he serves as the Lead Scientist for the Human-Guided Machine Learning Branch. His research centers on integrating human guidance with advanced AI/ML, with a significant current focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI. Dr. Waytowich and his team develop novel algorithms leveraging human feedback, human-in-the-loop machine learning, and reinforcement learning, increasingly applying these methods to steer, enhance, and align LLMs for complex tasks. A key application of this research is the development of COA-GPT for Command and Control (C2) planning. His broader interests include LLMs, generative AI, human-guided machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, human-agent teaming, and human-robot collaboration.

Before my stint with the Army Research Laboratory, I had the privilege of being a postdoctoral fellow under the esteemed [Paul Sajda](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/paul-sajda) at Columbia University in the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing. During this period, I delved deep into creating novel brain-computer interfaces. This pursuit was a continuation of my Ph.D. journey in Biomedical Engineering from Old Dominion University, where I worked closely with [Dean Krusienski](https://egr.vcu.edu/directory/dean.krusienski/) on practical brain-computer interface applications.

In addition to my research roles, I've been sharing my knowledge as an Adjunct Professor at both the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) and Anne Arundel Community College (AACC), where I teach Introduction to Machine Learning as well as other engineering and computer science courses. 

Having had the honor to present my findings at prominent AI/ML conferences like AAAI, ICML, NeurIPS and AAMAS, I remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in my field.
